            In the Fall of 2024, I graduated from the rigorous Columbia Engineering Coding Boot Camp. I now have the skills to build robust applications using a wide range of modern technologies. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems and the immediate satisfaction of fixing a bug. I thrive in team environments, welcoming the collaboration needed to meet the needs of the end user. After working on over thirty projects, I have the ability to apply my skills to further the web development community.
