            I was born and raised in Trinidad and Tobago. I love to travel, so I thought, why not move to the United States to study biology at Lincoln University? After completing my undergraduate degree, I returned to Trinidad to work in education, and then I came back to Maryland to work in education for seven more years. I love watching and playing football (soccer) and have coached the sport for seven years. In my spare time, I also like to play chess for fun.

            Now, I am taking the big step to change my career to a full-stack web developer. As a Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp graduate, I have acquired the skills to build robust applications using a wide range of modern technologies. I love this! I really enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems and the immediate satisfaction of fixing a bug. I also love the collaboration needed to meet the needs of the end user. After working on over thirty projects, my eyes are now primed for the web development world.
